> “Where do i find this, where can i get that, where’s the next part now ?". 

Booklovers would relate going through these question everytime they are trying to find a good read. The search for books in any form is so tedious, it takes us much more time to find a book than to finish it. Trying different shopping sites to find best deals, trying every pdf site to download books when in dire need. It’s just too much work, trying to find what is real and good.

But now the hard time is over, as with the help of our project, now we can easily complete all these tasks with a search.
Our Book library manager is a **GUI based project**, which searches the web for the given book, and makes it available to you if it is available anywhere on the internet. 
Along with Amazon and Flipkart title pages, we also provide you the links to download the book in PDF format. 

- Taking help of web scraping capabilities of Python, we search sites Amazon, Flipkart, Libgen, Archive.org, etc and extract information on the provided titles.

- Register and Login to keep track of all your favourites and bookmark the titles to find next.

- With the help of SQLite as our database, we can ensure fast processing of data, and also safety of it.

- Making our service more accessible, we also have Voice search capability enabled by Speech Recogniser Library. 

- Mutiple User Support

### Simply put, this e-library is going to make reading books, much more amazing than it already is.
